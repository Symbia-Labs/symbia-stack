      "codeHint": "principal: user + agent context",
      "problem": "Traditional auth models track users. But when an AI assistant makes a request on behalf of a user, you need to know: Who authorized this? Which assistant is executing? What capabilities were granted? What's the context?",
      "solution": "Every request in Symbia carries two principals: the user who authorized the action and the assistant executing it. Both are authenticated, both have declared capabilities, and both are audited.",
